               <h2>Testimony: My Journey Learning HTML and CSS

                Learning HTML and CSS is fun, hard and very confusing at the same time. Before I started, I didn’t fully understand how websites work, but because of this learning journey, I have gained a better understanding of how the web works at a fundamental level.
                
                HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, was my first step into web development. I learned that it helps me create things like headings, paragraphs, and pictures. It’s how we put everything in place. When I want to add text or a photo to a website, I use HTML to do it. There are tags in HTML, and each tag has a job, like telling the browser, "This is a title" or "Here’s a picture."
                
                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, was the next step, which is like painting and decorating the website. CSS helps me make everything look pretty and colorful. It allows me to change the colors, sizes, and styles of the text. I can also move things around on the page to make them look just right. I can make sure the website looks great on a big computer screen or a small phone. I also learned how to use selectors, classes, and IDs to apply styles across a webpage.
                
                One of my favorite things to learn was how to make websites work on different screens. Whether it's a big computer or a small phone, I can make sure the website looks good everywhere. That’s called "responsive design," and it’s nice because the site changes to fit any screen.
                
                Now that I’ve learned about these, I can create my own websites, make them pretty, and even make them work on all kinds of devices. I can’t wait to keep learning more and make better websites in the future.</h2>
